Homework Assignment #4: 
=======================

Background Information:
-----------------------

3. Go back to your application and integrate your chosen library so that it is referenced in the <head> of every page on your site.

4. Refactor your HTML templates (all of your HTML pages) to adapt your code to the grid system of the library. When you're done, every major component on every page should be responsive in some way.

5. Refactor your HTML to make use of the buttons, tables, modals and other styled components available in the library.

6. Go through and add any extra styles or additions you feel would improve the UI or UX of the site.

3. Once a user is created (or when they login) they should be taken to their dashboard. Their dashboard should display any "Todo Lists" they've created so far.

4. From the dashboard they should be able to create a new list or click on any existing list.

5. Once a list is created or visited, the user should be able to view all of the tasks on that list. The user should be able to name/rename the list, add tasks, remove tasks, or "check off" tasks as complete. They should also be able to delete the entire list.


Assignment Details:
-------------------

1. Given the specs above, make a list of all the individual routes and pages that will need to exist on your application. Now actually create those routes, and the empty HTML templates. Don't worry about filling in functionality yet, you are just creating the scaffolding of the application.

2. Choose the database you'd like to use for your app (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc). Whatever the choice, you'll want to install a working version of the database within your Ubuntu VM so your application can connect to it.

3. Design the database schema for your application. How many tables should exist? What columns should exist within those tables, and what should their data-types be? Once you've thought it out, now's the time to actually create those tables within the DB. Once you're done, export your schema / table-structure and that file in your application's folder. Don't worry about the data models yet, we'll tackle that in the next homework.
